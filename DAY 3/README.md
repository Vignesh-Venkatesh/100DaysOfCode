## **DAY 3**
---
Hmmmm... Unfortunately I wasn't able to commit yesterday because I had to complete a couple of assignments. Anyways, now I am back today.. üôÇ

### **Word.py**
---
This question was not that tough, it was pretty simple, I just had to convert the word into lower case or upper case based on the condition.

### **NearlyLuckyNumber.py**
---
This question was also pretty simple. It just needed the number of lucky digits to be compared with the lucky digits themselves. Now my explanation here might not make sense, but I can assure you that I will get better at explaining over time.

### **StonesonTheTable.py**
---
This question took me a lot of time, but it was only coz I was dumb to realise that I had a bug in my code where I didn't use the proper indices.

### **PanoramixsPrediction.py**
---
Hmmm.. This question has quite an interesting backstory.. So at first when I coded, I had no idea from where the tkinter module was imported, and because of that my runtime of the program was `182ms`. In this program I had also used a for loop to find out the prime number list repeatedly for each test case.

**The following link is my first submission:**

*[Vignesh's Paranomix's Prediction Submission (1)](https://codeforces.com/problemset/submission/80/149204899)*

The second time, I submitted the same file but this time with the import statement removed and the runtime came down to `92ms`.

*[Vignesh's Paranomix's Prediction Submission (2)](https://codeforces.com/problemset/submission/80/149205029)*

The third time, I just created a list with the prime numbers between 1 and 50 and removed the for loop that was used for finding the prime numbers repeatedly (which was dumb of me, of course ü§¶).. and th eruntime dropped to `62ms`.

### **Ultra-FastMathematician.py**
---
This was pretty easy.. At first I used an approach where I used the `int` datatype, but then I realised that I wouldn't be getting the leading zeros, and then converted it to an approach where i used `strings`.

### **Drinks.py**
---
I am not going to comment about this... This took me a minute to solve.. *(I can guarantee that for you as well, if u try solving it üòê)*

### **InsomniaCure.py**
---
No comments about this.. It was very easy to understand and was able to solve in a minute just like the previous problem, however I noticed that my runtime is `124ms`.. and am guessing that there could be an even more efficient solution. So if you find an even more efficient solution.. please help me with that üôÇ.
