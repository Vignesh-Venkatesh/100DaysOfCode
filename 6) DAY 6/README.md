## **DAY 6 (14-MAR-2022)**
---
I know, I know, I missed another day ðŸ˜”. I was very busy in moving into dorms and I was tired as soon as I was done moving..

Anyways let's get over that.. Now that I am back, I realised that I had to learn a bit about Javascript *(just a tiny bit ðŸ¥²)* in order to understand the fundamentals of **`React`**.

That is why I'll be following the freecodecamp tutorial on **`Javascript`**. 

So let's get started..!ðŸ¥³

**`onclick`** = is an event listener. It is used for listening clicks on a button which can then be used to execute a javascript function.

**Html part of the code:**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>Passenger Counter</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>People Entered:</h1>
        <h2 id="count-el">0</h2>
        <!-- button with onclick event listener named "increment" -->
        <button id="increment-btn" onclick="increment()">INCREMENT</button> 
        <script src="index.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>
```
**Javascript part of the code**
```javascript
function increment() {
    console.log("button was clicked")
}
```

I started this at 9:45PM today, and now it's about to be 11PM.. It's time for me to go to bed.. I'll come back tomorrow and update with a new project while simultaneously learning javascript from freecodecamp.
