## **DAY 1**
---
So, this is the beginning of my 100 days of code challenge, and I am pretty excited about
the outcome. As I mentioned in the decription of this repository, I won't be able to dedicate
my time completely *(as I am a college student and have assignments to complete)*, however, I'll
try my best to commit regularly. ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š

### **YoungPhysicist.py**

So, this is what started the challenge. Yep.
The time when I started this challenge, was around 9PM, so..., yea pretty much tired..
Although, I still persisted and began the challenge any ways. I tried solving the codeforces question
and it turned out to be pretty easy *(this is expected coz it is a <1300 rated question ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚)*.

Tbh, i don't think my thought process is really required here as it is a very simple question.

### **BeautifulMatrix.py**
---
This particular question was also not that tough. However, I did have a small bug in my program that wasted
10 mins of my time. The bug was that I forgot how list indices worked and just messed up the order by 1.

### **Borze.py**
---
Although all of the programs were easy, this particular program had to be the easiest of them all.
It literally just took me 2-2.5 minutes to code up. *(useless flex, I know ðŸ˜”)*

### **Final Thoughts:**
---
I thought that this was a great start to the challenge. I know this is a very small progress, but I am super tired, 
as I write this markdown file. I wanna go to sleep right now, but I can assure you that I would be committing 
alternatively *(if not regularly)* about what ever I code. My future plans include me trying to complete learning
DSA, try climbing up the A2OJ ladder and learn web development.

Alright then, that's it for today... See ya ðŸ‘‹
