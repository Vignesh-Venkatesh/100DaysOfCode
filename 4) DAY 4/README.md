Just starting out to do some problems from the A2OJ Ladder... Let's see how it goes..

---
### **AmusingJoke.py**
---
This question required me to look closely at what the question asked. This is because at first I had the wrong approach but then read the question once again and figured out a way to solve the problem. Overall, I think it was pretty easy to ssolve.

### **WayTooLongWords.py**
---
This question had to be the easiest of them all.. Literally solved it in a minute.. Try it out for yourself. It was simple and straight to the point.

### **Football.py**
---
This was a bit tricky coz I messed up the logic in my first attempt and failed one of the testcases. I then read through the problem and reformulated my approach and then eventually wrote a much cleaner code which in turn passed all the testcases.

**The following link is my first submission: *(Incorrect)***

Alright then, I guess this is it for today.. My plan for tomorrow is to study for Math but I'll still try coding few problems and this time I'll try solving level 2 questions as well. I'll also learn markdown in order to get this formatting done a bit more neatly ðŸ˜Š.

See yaaðŸ‘‹!!
